ðŸŒ€ Digital Twin of a Ceiling Fan
Simulating Real-World Airflow and Thermal Behavior in a Classroom Using Three.js

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This mini project presents a digital twin of a ceiling fan, built entirely with Three.js, to simulate the real-world physics of air particle behavior in an indoor classroom setting.

The simulation demonstrates how fan speed and blade angle affect airflow and thermal distribution, visualized through colored particles representing hot and cold air.
